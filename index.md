## Welcome to My GitHub Page

I used the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/colmand/colmand.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for this website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages runs [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in my site, from the content in my Markdown files.

Here is another [page of content](https://colmand.github.io/content-1.html) to try and test out linking.
